# Churn-Prediction
Binary classification using deep learning.

The primary objective of this project is to employ data science and machine learning techniques to analyze a Telecom service dataset, with the ultimate goal of predicting customer churn. Through comprehensive data visualization, we aim to identify key indicators such as Tenure and Monthly Rates that influence customer attrition. The project involves the development of a deep learning model using TensorFlow to achieve accurate predictions. The successful implementation of this model will not only enhance our understanding of customer behavior but also provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies to mitigate customer churn in the future.

In the future, I aim to deploy my churn prediction model in real-world scenarios, gaining a deep understanding of its lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment, and practical applications. As part of this journey, I plan to integrate databases and APIs to enhance its practicality and usability. By navigating through the various stages of the machine learning lifecycle and culminating in the deployment phase, I hope to refine my technical skills. Additionally, turning the project into a working website will not only make it more accessible but will also provide insights into how the churn prediction model fits into the real world of web technologies.
