# Churn-Prediction
Binary classification using deep learning.

The primary objective of this project is to employ data science and machine learning techniques to analyze a Telecom service dataset, with the ultimate goal of predicting customer churn. Through comprehensive data visualization, we aim to identify key indicators such as Tenure and Monthly Rates that influence customer attrition. The project involves the development of a deep learning model using TensorFlow to achieve accurate predictions. The successful implementation of this model will not only enhance our understanding of customer behavior but also provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies to mitigate customer churn in the future.
